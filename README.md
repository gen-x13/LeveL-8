### **🏆 Project : Reinforcement Learning Practice**

- **📌 Description:**  
  This project is a practice and mini tutorial for future and bigger projects.
  There's two environment : LunarLander and FrozenLake.  
  There is only one version available:
  - 🇬🇧 **English version**: Includes English commentary (`-en`).

- **🛠 Tech Stack:** Python, Gymnasium, Numpy, Logging, Matplotlib, Random.
- **⏳ Time to complete:** 2/3 hours for each practice.  

### **💭 My thoughts on this project:**  
This is my **eight project**, and I followed a tutorial for LunarLander.
- LunarLander was my first try and was quite easy to learn.
- FrozenLake made me understand how this work through practicing alone before getting help with tutorials and research.

It was a great learning experience, especially for **gymnasium and reinforcement learning functions**, **problem-solving skills** and **patience**.

💡 My strengths: Determination, self-taught and scientist mindset.

🚀 Areas for improvement: Work more with it.
